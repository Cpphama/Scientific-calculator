## 🧮 Custom Scientific Calculator

A feature-rich calculator with support for:

- Constants (π, e, g)
- Trig functions (sin, asin, sinh, etc.)
- Implicit multiplication
- Power/root logic (`^0.5`, `^(1/3)`)
- Error handling (syntax + math errors)

### ⚠️ Notes
- Not 100% bug-free — edge cases may cause unexpected results.
- Works as expected with correct mathematical input (e.g., using parentheses).
- Built with C++ and [your GUI library name].

### 🚀 Why I Built This
A personal challenge to explore parsing, evaluation, and GUI design.



### Impoetant

Needs a compiler with C++17 support
needs Raylib installed on the system or in lib/ folder of the CMakwLists.txt
